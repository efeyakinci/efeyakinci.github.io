It seems as the author is taking us on a journey through a city. This conversational tone sets up a unique point of view where the author is talking to us about his feelings and what he sees in the town. This point of view allows us to have a more personal and in-depth view of the author\u2019s feelings while still not being omniscient, leaving an air of mystery as to the true qualities of the author. For example, although the author tells us later on that that he will have time to make decisions, this really shows us that the author is indecisive, allowing us a view into his flawed personality."},{title:"Talks of Michelangelo",phrase:"Talking of Michelangelo.",type:"Allusion \u2014 Literary Device",body:"Here, the author refers to women talking about Michelangelo. It is generally agreed that talking of painters and art makes one appear more sophisticated. Here, the author uses the fact that people tend to talk about topics similar to this, not because they are sophisticated, but because they want to have the appearance of being sophisticated. This establishes the theme of the importance of appearances early on, and gives the reader a concrete example to consider."},{title:"Don't worry, we still have time.",type:"Key Words and Phrases",phrase:"And indeed there will be time\n\nTo wonder, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d and, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d\n\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\n\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair \u2014\n\n(They will say: \u201cHow his hair is growing thin!\u201d)",body:"Throughout the poem, the author uses variations of \u201cthere will be time\u201d to highlight how he feels that his indecisions are not an issue, because he thinks that he will have more time in the future to make decisions. However, here, he juxtaposes his idea that there will be more time to do the things he likes with the fact he is aging. This shows the reader that the character\u2019s thinking is fallacious, and that he is slowly throwing his time and life away as he keeps putting off his decisions into the future."},{title:"I can't decide!",type:"Syntax",phrase:"Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?\n\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.",body:"Here, the author emphasizes the character\u2019s indecision. Towards the end of the poem, he is indecisive about the smallest things. He asks himself a series of questions on what he should do, and he says that he will \u201cwear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\u201d This serves to show that the character wants to take control of his life, take risks, and stop being affected by others\u2019 perception of him. However, in a world so focused on perceptions and appearances, he struggles to do so."},{title:"Honesty",type:"Change In Direction",phrase:"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\n\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\n\nAnd in short, I was afraid.",body:"Here, the author signals another change in the direction of the poem. Up until this point, he had kept telling us that there will be more time, and then he had followed it up with his indecisions. However, at this point, he admits to us that he is afraid, and that he may already be out of time. He says that he has seen his greatness flicker, signaling to us that he has come to the realization that he is not at his best anymore. He also ends the stanza with \u201cI am afraid,\u201d signaling us that he realizes that he doesn\u2019t believe that \u201cthere will be more time\u201d either."},{title:"Not So Sure",type:"Change In Direction",phrase:"Do I dare\n\nDisturb the universe?",body:"Here, the author starts to openly experience uncertainty. Although we could have seen the implied uncertainty and indecisiveness in the main character as he tried to justify his indecisiveness by saying there would still be time, here, he starts to openly ask questions to himself. This theme of open indecisiveness is present in the following few stanzas as well, and signals the main character getting one more step closer to admitting his problem with indecisiveness."},{title:"An Older London",type:"Connections",phrase:"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\n\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,",body:"This description reminds me of images I used to see of 1850-1900s London. I think that this might have had some role to play in the author\u2019s choice of setting, as he was a British poet (although he was born in the United States.) The description makes me imagine the smog that would have been a result of the industrial revolution at the time. I think something else that might contribute is the description of the \u201cyellow fog\u201d and \u201cyellow smoke,\u201d but I think that is just because most photos from that time have a sepia tint due to the nature of the photography. Here is an link to an image that depicts what I described: https://bit.ly/2WEpfvH"},{title:"In Conclusion",type:"Personal Feelings",phrase:"By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\n\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.",body:"I am not usually one to enjoy poems; I don\u2019t really enjoy copious use of symbolism, and I tend to read works where there is a more clear message. I think that this is one of the reasons I really enjoyed this poem. Although there is a lot of symbolism and references, there is one message that stands out: indecisiveness leaves one feeling weak and powerless. I felt this feeling throughout the whole poem; as the character told us of his indecisions and worries, I felt pity for him, and saw a clear lesson on being decisive and confident in life. I also felt that the author used symbolism to strengthen a clear message, rather than hide a message behind it. I thought that this both made the poem easier to understand, and gave it a stronger message. In conclusion, I really enjoyed reading the poem, and I can say that this is one of the only poems that I have enjoyed reading."},{title:"Not Hamlet",type:"Allusion",phrase:"No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;",body:"Here, we can see that the character has accepted his weaknesses. He admits this by admitting that he is not Prince Hamlet, but rather an attendant lord. Prince Hamlet is the protagonist in Shakespeare\u2019s play \u201cHamlet.\u201d This can be interpreted as the character admitting that he is not in control, that he is not the protagonist in his story, but rather a weaker character. "},{title:"Research",type:"Research",phrase:"Research on this poem.",body:"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufock was a defining poem of the Modernist movement by T.S. Elliot. T.S. Elliot was a notable figure in the modernist movement, and drew inspiration from other accomplished poets such as Ezra Pound. (Poets.org, Academy of American Poets, poets.org/poet/t-s-eliot. ) The poem dealt with issues such as alienation and loneliness that were key features of Modernist poems. (\u201cModernism.\u201d Encyclop\xe6dia Britannica, Encyclop\xe6dia Britannica, Inc., www.britannica.com/art/Modernism-art.) Similarly, fragmentation was also a key feature of poems from this time. This can be seen in the way that Elliot chooses to use stream of consciousness to take us from description to description with no strong connections between what he tells us. Finally, I think that the epigraph at the start deserves a little explanation. It is an excerpt from another poem by Dante called Inferno (Inferno / Dante Alghieri, www.worldofdante.org/comedy/dante/inferno.xml/1.27.) It translates as \n\nI but thought that my response were made/to one perhaps returning to the world,/this tongue/of flame would cease to flicker./But since, up from these depths, no one has yet/returned alive,/if what I hear is true,/I answer without fear of being shamed.\n\nThis excerpt makes biblical references to the tongues of fire, among other things. We can see more biblical imagery in the form of allusion to strengthen its message and its Modernist properties."}];function v(e){return Object(a.jsx)(l.b.span,{onClick:e.whenClicked,whileHover:{cursor:"pointer"},style:{fontWeight:"800"},variants:e.variants,custom:e.color,children:e.children})}var k=n(15),I=n.n(k);function j(){var e=0,t=Object(i.useState)(""),n=Object(r.a)(t,2),o=n[0],s=n[1],h=Object(i.useState)(),d=Object(r.a)(h,2),m=d[0],p=d[1],w=Object(i.useState)(!1),k=Object(r.a)(w,2),j=(k[0],k[1],{enterPage:function(e){return{color:e}}}),x=function(e){p(Object(a.jsx)(u,{analysisObject:e},e))};return Object(i.useEffect)((function(){x(new f("N/A","Welcome To My Analysis!","You can click on any of the colored words to see the analysis for that section!","Introduction")),b.forEach((function(t){y.poem=g()(y.poem,t.phrase,(function(n){return e++,Object(a.jsx)("span",{onClick:function(){return x(t)},children:Object(a.jsx)(v,{color:I()(),variants:j,children:n})},e.toString())}))})),s(y.poem)}),[]),Object(a.jsx)("div",{style:{height:"100vh",width:"100vw"},children:Object(a.jsxs)(c.a,{container:!0,style:{display:"flex",flexDirection:"row",alignItems:"center",height:"100%"},children:[Object(a.jsx)(c.a,{item:!0,xs:12,sm:5,style:{height:"90%",width:"100%",boxShadow:"21px 21px 46px #f5f5f5, -21px -21px 46px #fafafa",margin:"0em 2em",borderRadius:"2em",padding:"1em 2em"},children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{style:{display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",overflow:"auto",alignItems:"center",height:"100%"},children:[Object(a.jsx)(v,{color:I()(),children:Object(a.jsx)("h2",{style:{fontWeight:"600"},onClick:function(){return x(new f("","Paraphrase","The poem talks about a man who seems to think he has quite a bit of experience in life.

We then see him concerned with his appearances and aging again as he reflects back on this throughout his indecisiveness. As the poem goes on, the main character seems to realize more and more that he has many flaws. He tries to push himself to make decisions and reclaim his autonomy to little avail, and the poem ends on a negative note. The character ends up regretting his indecisiveness all the way until the end of the poem.
