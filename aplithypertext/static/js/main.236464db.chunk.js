This point of view allows us to have a more personal and in-depth view of the author\u2019s feelings while still not being omniscient, leaving an air of mystery as to the true qualities of the author.

It is generally agreed that talking of painters and art makes one appear more sophisticated. Here, the author uses the fact that people tend to talk about topics similar to this, not because they are sophisticated, but because they want to have the appearance of being sophisticated.

However, here, he juxtaposes his idea that there will be more time to do the things he likes with the fact he is aging.

He asks himself a series of questions on what he should do, and he says that he will \u201cwear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\u201d This serves to show that the character wants to take control of his life, take risks, and stop being affected by others\u2019 perception of him.

However, at this point, he admits to us that he is afraid, and that he may already be out of time.
