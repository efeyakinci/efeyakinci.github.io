However, here, he juxtaposes his idea that there will be more time to do the things he likes with the fact he is aging.

Towards the end of the poem, he is indecisive about the smallest things.

The description makes me imagine the smog that would have been a result of the industrial revolution at the time. I think something else that might contribute is the description of the “yellow fog” and “yellow smoke,” but I think that is just because most photos from that time have a sepia tint due to the nature of the photography.

I felt this feeling throughout the whole poem; as the character told us of his indecisions and worries, I felt pity for him, and saw a clear lesson on being decisive and confident in life. I also felt that the author used symbolism to strengthen a clear message, rather than hide a message behind it. I thought that this both made the poem easier to understand, and gave it a stronger message.

Alfred Prufock was a defining poem of the Modernist movement by T.S. Elliot. T.S. Elliot was a notable figure in the modernist movement, and drew inspiration from other accomplished poets such as Ezra Pound. (Poets.org, Academy of American Poets, poets.org/poet/t-s-eliot. ) The poem dealt with issues such as alienation and loneliness that were key features of Modernist poems. (“Modernism.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., www.britannica.com/art/Modernism-art.) Similarly, fragmentation was also a key feature of poems from this time. This can be seen in the way that Elliot chooses to use stream of consciousness to take us from description to description with no strong connections between what he tells us. Finally, I think that the epigraph at the start deserves a little explanation. It is an excerpt from another poem by Dante called Inferno (Inferno / Dante Alghieri, www.worldofdante.org/comedy/dante/inferno.xml/1.27.) It translates as \\n\\nI but thought that my response were made/to one perhaps returning to the world,/this tongue/of flame would cease to flicker./But since, up from these depths, no one has yet/returned alive,/if what I hear is true,/I answer without fear of being shamed.\\n\\nThis excerpt makes biblical references to the tongues of fire, among other things. We can see more biblical imagery in the form of allusion to strengthen its message and its Modernist properties.\"\n\n    }\n]\n\nexport default analysis;","import React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\n\nexport default function ClickablePhrase(props) {\n    return (\n        <motion.span onClick={props.whenClicked} whileHover={{cursor: 'pointer'}} style={{fontWeight: '800'}} variants={props.variants} custom={props.color}>\n            {props.children}\n        </motion.span>\n    )\n}\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { Grid, TextField, Button } from '@material-ui/core'\nimport { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'\nimport AnalysisCard from './AnalysisCard.js';\nimport Analysis from './Analysis.js';\nimport replaceString from 'react-string-replace';\nimport poem from '../../poem.json';\nimport data from './data';\nimport ClickablePhrase from './ClickablePhrase.js';\nimport randomColor from 'randomcolor';\nimport { analysisVariants } from './MainPoemVariants';\n\nexport default function MainPoem() {\n    let uniqueKey = 0;\n    const [poemContent, setPoemContent] = useState(\"\");\n    const [currentAnalysisCard, setCurrentAnalysisCard] = useState();\n    const [testState, setTestState] = useState(false);\n    const paraphrase = \"The poem talks about a man who seems to think he has quite a bit of experience in life.

We can see this early on with the phrase “Talks of Michelangelo.” He seemingly tries to convince himself that he still has time to make these decisions. We then see him concerned with his appearances and aging again as he reflects back on this throughout his indecisiveness. As the poem goes on, the main character seems to realize more and more that he has many flaws. He tries to push himself to make decisions and reclaim his autonomy to little avail, and the poem ends on a negative note. The character ends up regretting his indecisiveness all the way until the end of the poem.
